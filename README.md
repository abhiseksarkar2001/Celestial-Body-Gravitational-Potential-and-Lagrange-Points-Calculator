# Celestial-Body-Gravitational-Potential-and-Lagrange-Points-Calculator
This code calculates the effective gravitational potential of a celestial body system and the Lagrange points of the system.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Python and the NumPy library installed on your system in order to run this code.

## Running the code
To run the code, simply open the script in a Python interpreter and execute it. The effective gravitational potential of the system and the Lagrange points will be printed to the console.

## Customizing the code
You can customize the code by modifying the values of the following variables:

G: The gravitational constant.
m_*: The mass of each celestial body in the system.
r_*: The radius of each celestial body in the system.
L_*: The angular momentum of each celestial body in the system.

## Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - A library for scientific computing with Python.
